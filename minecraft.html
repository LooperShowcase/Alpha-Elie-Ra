          Minecraft is a sandbox game developed by Mojang Studios.<br />
          The game was created by Markus "Notch" Persson in the Java programming
          language. Following several early private testing versions, it was
          first made public in May 2009 before being fully released in November
          2011,<br />
          with Notch stepping down and Jens "Jeb" Bergensten taking over
          development. Minecraft is the best-selling video game in history,<br />
          with over 238 million copies sold and nearly 140 million monthly
          active players as of 2021 and has been ported to several platforms
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          Minecraft focuses on allowing the player to explore,<br />
          interact with and modify a dynamically-generated map made of one cubic
          meter sized blocks.<br />
          In addition to blocks, the environment features plants,,<br />
          mobs and items. Some activities in the game include building, mining
          for ore,<br />
          fighting hostile mobs and crafting new blocks and tools by gathering
          various resources found in the game. The game's open-ended model
          allows players to create structures, creations and artwork on various
          competitive or collaborative multiplayer servers or their
          single-player maps.<br />
          Other features include redstone circuits for logic computations and
          remote actions, minecarts and tracks, and a mysterious underworld
          called the Nether. A designated but completely optional goal of the
          game is to travel to a dimension called the End and defeat the ender
          dragon.

        <h3>Survival mode</h3>
        <p>
          In survival mode, players have to gather natural resources such as
          wood and stone found in the environment in order to craft certain
          blocks and items. Depending on the difficulty, monsters spawn in
          darker areas outside a certain radius of the character, requiring
          players to build a shelter at night. The mode also has a health bar
          which is depleted by attacks from mobs, falls, drowning, falling into
          lava, suffocation, starvation, and other events. Players also have a
          hunger bar, which must be periodically refilled by eating food in-game
          (except in peaceful difficulty). If the hunger bar is depleted,
          automatic healing will stop and eventually health will deplete. Health
          replenishes when players have a nearly full hunger bar or continuously
          on peaceful difficulty. Players can craft a wide variety of items in
          Minecraft. Craftable items include armor, which mitigates damage from
          attacks; weapons (such as swords or axes), which allows monsters and
          animals to be killed more easily; and tools (such as pickaxes or
          hoes), which break certain types of blocks more quickly. Some items
          have multiple tiers depending on the material used to craft them, with
          higher-tier items being more effective and durable. Players can
          construct furnaces, which can cook food, process ores, and convert
          materials into other materials. Players may also exchange goods with a
          villager (NPC) through a trading system, which involves trading
          emeralds for different goods and vice versa. The game has an inventory
          system, allowing players to carry a limited number of items. Upon
          dying, items in the players' inventories are dropped unless the game
          is reconfigured not to do so. Players then re-spawn at their spawn
          point, which by default is where players first spawn in the game and
          can be reset by sleeping in a bed or using a respawn anchor. Dropped
          items can be recovered if players can reach them before they disappear
          or despawn after 5 minutes. Players may acquire experience points by
          killing mobs and other players, mining, smelting ores, breeding
          animals, and cooking food. Experience can then be spent on enchanting
          tools, armor and weapons. Enchanted items are generally more powerful,
          last longer, or have other special effects
